assemblet

https://assemblet.patchouli.dev/

Setting up the database:

    On your preferred operating system, download PostgreSQL and create a databast named assemblet.
    Make a user named postgres (if they didn't exist already) and set their password to root.
    Give the postgres user priviliges to the assemblet database.
    Import the assembletPS.sql file into the assemblet database.

How to run:

    Download python and pip
    In terminal, go into assemblet folder cd PATH_TO_ASSEMBLET
    Install requirements pip install -r requirements.txt
    Run flask python app.py
    Open browser, go to localhost:5000
    To create your own puzzles, sign up and add that username to the admin table in postgres.

Note: Deploying it with the instructions above will result in a site with no puzzles.
The application is already deployed on https://assemblet.patchouli.dev/ which has puzzles created.
basic structure of program (as of now)

    flask (python) is used to run the server
    html/css/js files have the actual pages
    database will be run in the background separately, but keep in repository for now
