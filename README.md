# how to pull / push into git (faster way of committing changes)
- open terminal
- `cd PATH_TO_ASSEMBLET` (maybe this is something like `cd C:\Users\jiayang\assemblet`
- one time only: `git config --global user.name "jiayang"`, then `git config --global user.email "jc9555@nyu.edu"`

# how to work on database
- install xampp
- go to the web interface and upload the database we have

# basic structure of program (as of now)

- flask (python) is used to run the server
- html/css/js files have the actual pages
- database will be run in the background separately, but keep in repository for now
